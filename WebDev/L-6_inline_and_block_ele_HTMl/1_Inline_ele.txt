In HTML, inline elements are those that don't force a new line to start in the document flow.
Inline elemens do not start one anew line and only take up as much as width as necessary.
Here are the 10 most commonly used inline elements:

<a>: Anchor element, used for hyperlinks.
<span>: Generic inline container.
<strong>: Indicates strong importance, typically rendered as bold.
<em>: Emphasized text, typically rendered as italic.
<img>: Image element.
<br>: Line break.
<input>: Input field for forms.
<label>: Label for form elements.
<button>: Button element.
<select>: Dropdown selection list.
